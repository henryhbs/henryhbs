ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! Iâ€™m Henry Bastos aka @henryhbs, a 31yo graphic and UI designer moving back to web and software development.

Iâ€™m currently speedrunning/diving into some front end with HTML, CSS and JS so I can (re)learn my ways into programming (I used to be a fullstack web dev back in 2012, plus making graphics). Meanwhile, I'm also dedicating myself to Python because I just fell in love with the language and all its possibilities.
Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborate on projects related to data science and machine learning whenever possible, as I intend to either go for a data science career in a near future or choose a more direct approach on AI.

ðŸ“« If you feel I can be of any help, you can always reach me through email - hxnrybs@gmail.com - or via Instagram dm - @hxz.yb. I'm very certain you'll know where to find me!

See you anytime soon! Have a very special day, a great week and an awesome journey.
